# Hootation

*under development...check back later*

Hootation is an ontology verbalization tool that was at first conceived to help in extrinsically evaluating ontologies and knowledge graphs encoded in OWL or RDF. Hootation takes each OWL logical axiom and converts them into natural language text to allow subject matter experts to assess each encoded statement within the artifact's knowledge base. This current iterative release provides a desktop GUI to circumvent the use of command line and some large language model support.

Hootation was developed in Java 17 using Apache Netbeans, along with supporting APIs (such as OWL API, Apache Jena, SimpleNLG), and reused code initially developed by the Agile Knowledge Engineering and Semantic Web (AKSW) Research Group.
